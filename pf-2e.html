            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Pathfinder 2e is a good bit more complicated than Dungeons and Dragons 5e. Drawing from older editions of Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder hearkens back to an earlier era of TTRPG when 
                most games were more technical in nature. In terms of complexity, Pathfinder is great for players looking for something a bit more customizable than Dungeons and Dragons. One thing that helps ease the complexity is the fact that the rules are available for free online (without piracy) at the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com">Archives of Nethys.</a> The steps of creating a character in Pathfinder
                are rather similar to the ones in D&D 5e, but with some key differences in the order and particulars that makes it a rather different experience. The steps are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concept</li>
                <li>Basic Attributes</li>
                <li>Ancestry</li>
                <li>Background</li>
                <li>Class</li>
                <li>Finalize Attributes</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                The concept of a character is very important, as it informs the kinds of character options that will be considered all the way through the game. Unline D&D 5e, Pathfinder has a network of prerequisites for all sorts of options, so at least some planning ahead will be necessary.
                Planning is not strictly necessary, but forgoing any forward planning will mean that some really cool options will not be available.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Basic Attributes -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Basic Attributes</h2>
            <p>
                Though this step is listed in the rules, it's more a comment on how statistics work. Dungeons and Dragons has skills that range from 1 to 20, with some calculation for bonuses from -5 to +5. Pathfinder is much simpler,
                dealing only with scores from -1 to +6 that accumulate from character creation decisions and levelling up.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Ancestry -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Ancestry</h2>
            <p>
                In Pathfinder, Ancestry refers to what a character is biologically. This includes things like Humans, Elves, and Dwarves, but also accounts for some more unique things, like robots or people that have been changed by magic.
                Ancestry grants you some hit points to start with, three attribute boosts (usually some of them pre-defined) or four boosts and a penalty. Ancestries also come with languages, perhaps a sense (like the ability to see in the dark) and one Ancestry feat.
                Ancestry feats are options that belong to a particular ancestry, such as Gnomes possibly having a special topic of interest that they can research or Elves getting benefits from living so much longer than anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ancestries also have sub-categories called Heritages. Heritages indicate a particular region or subgroup of the ancestry, such as Umbral Gnomes that live underground. Some Ancestry feats require a particular Heritage.
            </p>

        <!-- Background -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Backgrounds in Pathfinder add some additional skills to a character's repertoire. Each background grants two ability boosts, two skill proficiencies, and a feat that relates to the background.
                Some of these feats can be rather useful, especially when used in conjunction with other features that synergize with it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Classes -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Class</h2>
            <p>
                Classes in Pathfinder are a good deal more bare-bones than in D&D on their own. A class grants an ability boost to its main ability, as well as the basic skills and equipment proficiencies that a character needs to play the class.
                In addition, classes grant some hit points each level and some basic abilities to help the character function. Most importantly, however, are the class feats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every class has a variety of feats every few levels that grant additional (and powerful) functionality to a class. This allows for players to customize what their character can do, with results in far more unique characters at the cost of increased complexity.
                As characters level up, they will get more feats of all kinds. These types include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Class feats</li>
                <li>Skill feats</li>
                <li>Ancestry feats</li>
                <li>General feats</li>
                <li>Archetype feats</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some classes also have subclasses of some description (they are called many things, varying widely by class). These offer some additional choice when it comes to features, as well as access to a handful of unique feats, but overall tend to offer a bit less chouce than some of the other systems in Pathfinder. That is, unless that subclass is an Archetype as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Archetypes are bundles of feats that are separate from classes (though some require specific classes). Instead of a class feat, one can instead choose to draw from an archetype, which will allow the character to branch out into different abilities instead of focusing on class feats.
                In a way, archetypes are like mini-classes. The first feat in each archetype is a "Dedication" feat, which locks you out of other archetypes (unless otherwise stated) until you pick two more feats from that archetype.
                There are many unique archetypes, but there are also archetypes for each of the classes that allow characters to dip into the basics of another class.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Character Finalization -->
        <section class="mb-4 content-section">
            <h2>Finalize Attributes</h2>
            <p>
                Finally, one must tally up all of the attribute boosts given by each source and add them together. The three (or five, if there's a penalty) from ancestry, the two from background, and the one from class.
                From each source, you can only put one point in a statistic. For example, if an ancestry has two "Free" boosts, you cannot put more than one in Dexterity -- you must put each Free boost into a different one. However, a Free boost from Background can be applied to Dexterity, as it's from a different source.
                After this, a final set of four free boosts can be applied to round things out. Once these are applied, the character is complete! The final step is to go through all the skills, equipment, and spells and calculate the bonuses for each.
