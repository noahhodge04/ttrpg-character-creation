            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons 5e has a fairly simple set of steps for character creation. As far as systems go, it has a decent learning curve but is not quite
                so complex as systems like Pathfinder 2e, earlier editions of D&D, or other d20 systems. The steps are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Concept</li>
                <li>Statistics</li>
                <li>Race (Elf, Dwarf, Human, etc.)</li>
                <li>Class</li>
                <li>Background and Personality</li>
                <li>Equipment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This system doesn't have much in the way of prerequisites for future character options. A number of 'feats' later on require different skills (like being strong enough to be a 'grappler'), require a particular race (being a Halfling to enhance their 'lucky' ability),
                or the ability to cast spells. This makes thinking ahead unnecessary unless you want something fairly particular. Characters will, mechanically, not feel too different from one another. However,
                the way that players roleplay (or otherwise portray) their characters is a source of individuality.

        <!-- Concept -->
        <section>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                The concept is one of the most important parts of creating a character in any TTRPG. A concept helps to narrow down what sorts of character options are picked and is essential to give
                a personality and some degree of backstory to inform the character's actions. A concept can be as simple as "a guy with a big sword" and as complicated as a 7 page story about the life
                of a bird lawyer, though the complexity does not matter in most games.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Statistics -->
        <section>
            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <p>
                Character statistics are the core of Dungeons and Dragons (and most TTRPG I have played). In this game, the six abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
                These will determine what a character is good at, as well as what classes they might perform best in. Sometimes, this step comes later (namely when a concept involving a particular class is involved),
                but doing this first makes for a more sequential process with less placeholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ability scores range from 1 to 20, with a bonus calculated by subtracting 10, dividing by 2, and removing any decimal values. Thus, a score of 10 has a bonus of 0, a score of 8 has -1, and a score of 16 has +3. It is rather confusing, but it's something that more experienced players know well and will help newer players with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, people roll dice for their statistics by rolling four six-sided dice (known as d6), ignoring the lowest number, and adding the rest up. This is done six times, and each total is given to one ability.
                This method allows for high highs and low lows, as well as more variety in the overall ability in characters. However, some game masters and players prefer more consistent methods, like Standard Array or Point Buy.
                In Standard Array, players have scores of 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 to assign to each statistic. In Point Buy, each skill starts at 8 and can be increased by spending points from a pool, with higher scores costing more points.
                Point Buy gets used a lot in games that have similar systems of statistics.

        <!-- Race -->
        <section>
            <h2>Race</h2>
            <p>
                Race in Dungeons and Dragons refers to a variety of species and ancestries that player characters can be. Humans, Elves, and Dwarves are staples of fantasy, and the rulebooks contain a wide variety
                of options to choose from. Character race grants additional scores to different abilities as well as some unique abilities. Elves, for example, get a bonus to Dexterity and meditate for 4 hours instead of sleeping for 8 hours each night.
                Aside from the ability boosts (which are often nullified using an optional rule) and unique traits, race has little impact beyond roleplay.

        <!-- Class -->
        <section>
            <h2>Class</h2>
            <p>
                Classes in Dungeons and Dragons contain most of what a character can do. There are 12 standard classes, each one filling its own niche in some way or another. They are often categorized based on their use of magic,
                with martial classes using none, half-casters using a little bit, and full-casters focusing on it. Each class has its own desired abilitiy scores, and there's a variety of subclasses to choose from for each (some of which desire different abilities). The standard classes are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Barbarian, a martial warrior that enters a battle rage to take down foes</li>
                    <li>Bard, a spellcaster that uses the arts (especially music) to support allies and hamper enemies</li>
                    <li>Cleric, a divine spellcaster that channels the power of their deity in order to heal their allies and harm their foes</li>
                    <li>Druid, a natural spellcaster that can manipulate the forces of nature and turn into animals</li>
                    <li>Fighter, a capable and versatile warrior</li>
                    <li>Monk, an expert martial artist that manipulates the flow of Ki to perform feats of agility and prowess</li>
                    <li>Paladin, an oath-bound warrior that channels the power of their oath into mighty strikes</li>
                    <li>Ranger, a warrior in tune with nature</li>
                    <li>Rogue, a skillful and cunning specialist that is great at sneaking, stealing, and stabbing</li>
                    <li>Sorcerer, a spellcaster that draws from their bloodline to cast and manipulate powerful spells</li>
                    <li>Warlock, a unique spellcaster that borrows power from a patron being (usually with strings attached)</li>
                    <li>Wizard, a studious caster that specializes in particular fields of spellcasting and can collect an impressive repertoire of spells</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <!-- Background and Personality, combined becaase they are tied together in the rules -->
        <section>
            <h2>Background and Personality</h2>
            <p>
                The Background section has a number of ready-to-pick options for characters, offering some basic equipment, skills, and a small feature relevant to the background. In addition, backgrounds tend to 
                recommend a variety of personality traits to inspire characters, though you can always make them up yourself. In fact, custom backgrounds are fairly easy to make if none of the options fit!
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Equipment -->
        <section>
            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <p>
                Equipment can be simple or a bit more complicated, depending on desire (and of course, the concept!). In addition to what comes from backgrounds, characters can choose to take some starting equipment from their class
                (usually a bag with bedding and food, some weapons, armor, and any other bare essentials for the class) or starting gold to purchase their own. Equipment includes many things, such as armor, weapons, clothing, wands and
                staves, potions, tools, and really anything that someone would carry with them. Armor is important for most characters (aside from Sorcerers and Wizards, perhaps), weapons for martials, and foci (wand, orb, staff, etc.) for casters.
